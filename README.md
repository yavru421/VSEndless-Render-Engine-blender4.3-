VSEndless - Advanced FFmpeg Render Engine for Blender's VSE

The VSEndless render engine is a custom solution designed specifically for Blender's Video Sequence Editor (VSE), integrating advanced FFmpeg capabilities directly into the rendering process. By enabling fine-tuned control over encoding settings such as resolution, codec (H.264/H.265), bitrate, and audio parameters, VSEndless ensures professional-grade outputs with unparalleled customization.

Key features include:

Seamless FFmpeg integration for optimized video and audio processing.
Support for NVENC hardware encoding for faster renders.
Flexible aspect ratio, custom frame rate, and sample rate configurations.
Intuitive UI in Blender’s Properties panel, allowing straightforward adjustments.
The engine processes the timeline data from the VSE, constructs an FFmpeg pipeline with custom filters (e.g., Lanczos scaling), and outputs high-quality MP4 files tailored to your specifications. Built with creators in mind, VSEndless bridges the gap between Blender’s VSE and powerful external encoding tools.
