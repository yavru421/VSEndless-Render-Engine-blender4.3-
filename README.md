# a little bit about me, I'm pretty new to development; I'm actually a Journeyman Carpenter by trade, but I live in Wisconsin and its -17F outside right now. 
so I started doing some video editing with my drone videos---then video editing for other people----then discovered ffmpeg, cudatoolkit, and yeah now Im here

#So I am greatly humbled by all the positive feedback from you guys out there, just bear with me, I'm not super good at this yet lol
I'm very open to constructive criticism, thnaks again!
